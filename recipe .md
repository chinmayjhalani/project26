The usual method of making vanilla milkshake is by blending milk, vanilla ice cream and vanilla extract. this method gives a creamier and rich shake due to the addition of ice cream.
While The simplest vanilla shake can be made just with milk, sugar and vanilla extract. this is a simple and easy method.
A variation is also to add some cream when blending milk with vanilla extract & sugar. Adding cream makes the shake thick and creamy.

1. Milk
For making milkshakes, it is Always better to use whole milk or full-fat milk which gives a rich creamier and thicker consistency. That said you can even use toned milk or skimmed milk but just that the consistency will be light and not rich.

2. Vanilla ice cream
The ice cream has to be a real ice cream and not a frozen dessert. if you live in India, check the ingredients and most ice cream manufactures sell ice cream where vegetable oil is used. These are sold as frozen desserts and many consumers mistakenly buy these. As far as I am aware, amul ice cream is the only ice cream which has milk. So do check the ingredients before you buy.The ice cream has to be real and made from milk or cream. Though the best option is to use homemade ice cream, it is not feasible at times to make homemade vanilla ice cream due to lack of time. It will be even better if the vanilla ice cream has vanilla beans added or real vanilla extract added. Most vanilla ice cream brands use artificial vanilla essence or vanillin.
3. Ice cream and milk ratio
I use the proportion of ¼ cup milk to 3 medium sized ice cream scoops for a thicker, creamier and rich vanilla milkshake. To suit your tastebuds, you can easily change this proportion or ratio.

For a less thick shake –  add ½ cup milk to 3 medium sized scoops.
For a thin milkshake – add ¾ to 1 cup milk for 3 scoops.
4. Vanilla
The best flavor comes from using vanilla beans or real vanilla extract. I prefer to use homemade vanilla extract for a good vanilla aroma. In case you do not have vanilla, then just skip it. A good vanilla ice cream is all that is needed.
5. Toppings & garnish
Mostly in cafes, whipped cream is added as a topping on vanilla shake. Whipped cream may or may not be there in your kitchen at all times. So you can make use of nuts, dry fruits, berries, chocolate sprinkles, sweet wafers that can be added as a topping on the milkshake. You can even crush some cookies and add them. You can also add caramel syrup, chocolate syrup to the shake.
